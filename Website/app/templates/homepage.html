        <p class = "lead">What is Cybersecurity?</p>
        <p class="m-4">
            Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
        </p>
        <p class = "lead">Why is Cybersecurity important?</p>
        <p class="m-4">
            Cybersecurity is a key concern not only for computer scientists, but also for professionals from all relevant disciplines. Lack of cybersecurity can affect businesses, state governments, and even national security. We are enduring the prevalence of cyber-threats and attacks. Cyberattacks are considered a threat against critical infrastructure sectors, and malicious cyber-activity has cost the US economy $57 to $109 billion in 2016.

        <p class = "lead">What we can do with deep learning for cybersecurity?</p>
	    <p class="m-4">
		    Network traffic content is generated rapidly with tremendous volume, which makes human annotation not possible. A more feasible solution is to develop algorithms to inspect the network traffic. But there is a concern of violating privacy for organizations to share real-life data for the training of algorithms. Therefore, to achieve training data for classification of network traffic, we propose to utilize generative adversarial networks (GAN) for generating synthetic cybersecurity data.

        <p class = "display-4 m-4">What is NetFlow ?</p>
        <p class = "m-4">
        NetFlow is a feature that was introduced on Cisco routers around
        1996 that provides the ability to collect IP network traffic as
        it enters or exits an interface. By analyzing the data provided by NetFlow, a network administrator can determine things such as the source and destination of traffic, class of service, and the causes of congestion. A typical flow monitoring setup (using NetFlow) consists of three main components:
        [1]
Flow exporter: aggregates packets into flows and exports flow records towards one or more flow collectors.
Flow collector: responsible for reception, storage and pre-processing of flow data received from a flow exporter.
Analysis application: analyzes received flow data in the context of intrusion detection or traffic profiling, for example.

        <p class = "display-4 m-4">What is Cyclostationarity ?</p>
        <p class = "m-4">
        A cyclostationary process is a signal having statistical properties that vary cyclically with time, so it can also be viewed as multiple interleaved stationary processes. Network traffic presents short- term with long-term temporal behaviors, and this fact has been traditionally leveraged for network design and performance evaluation aims. Considering two different simple approaches based on the observation of the network volume traffic, we define thresholds (red dashed lines) as below. If traffic volume exceeds the range, an anomaly is signaled. Stationary approach computes fixed threshold values from the statistical variation; cyclostationarity approach considers the fact that threshold vary over time by using mean value of the observed variable computed for the same hour at all days.

         From the figure we can see why cyclostationarity of the network flows is necessary to be considered when building models of network flows, as it can enhance the performance of the models hugely from stationary approach. With the importance of understanding the cyclostationarity highlighted, there are only few works have used this feature for anomaly detection purposes in the security context. But analysis of cyclostationarity is limited by the short duration of the traces. Datasets need to span for several cycles of study (days or weeks) to make it possible to evaluate the cyclostationarity. Thus, the UGRâ€™16 dataset has been raised, with an essential requirement as capturing long duration network flows, so that the training of algorithms based on it considering cyclostationarity is feasible.
